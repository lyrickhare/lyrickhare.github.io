                Hi! Here I will discuss about different parts of my life journey,
                majority of which will be related to JEE days, IIT days and my learings
                during this time. Since, this is a personal blog, it will also have some
                spices and tea from my personal life :p. However, there are higher chances
                of having links of linux / ML / finance tutorials, from my medium account 
                for most of the days. Also, if someone is reading this first then please
                navigate to the about me section of the website. Do connect on linkedIn, 
                that is the only platform, where I am active.
            </p>

            <h2 class="post-title">Getting More Disciplined</h2>
            <p class="post-date">19/12/2023</p>
            <p class="post-text">
		Yesterday, was kinda break, I didn't write, I was just reading a quant book, yes those are really interesting, if u want to access them, they are on my github, with repo names books (obviously it is just a fork of someone else's repo). Today, my plan is to follow the schedule as diligently as possible. While reading another book, I realized that it is important to have most of my day packed with important but not enjoyable and enjoyable tasks; because important and enjoyable tasks are difficult to find out. Currently, my g-calendar is filled with important but not enjoyable tasks, so, either I need to make my current important tasks enjoyable or need to findout some tasks that are enjoyable. I also discovered that I really enjoy riding bike / cycle (not sure about car cz never drove one); but I am thinking to pursue music (especially guitar), 1st cz it looks cool and  2nd it inculcates discipline. I already have a guitar, so I don't have to make a new investment on a instrument, the only investment is time.
